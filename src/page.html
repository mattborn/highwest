      <h2>About High West</h2>
      <p>
        High West Development Group was founded on a simple premise: big-firm experience, small-firm intentionality. Our
        team has managed over $1 billion in real estate construction value — from $100M+ institutional deals to
        multifamily housing and boutique hospitality projects — and we’ve chosen to do this work differently.
      </p>
      <p>
        We believe the best projects come from a small, focused team that can move with precision and care. We’re not
        chasing scale. We’re choosing projects where we can be deeply involved, where our experience makes a real
        difference, and where the end result adds lasting value to both investors and communities.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the Mountain West, where nature sets the pace, we build thoughtfully — creating places that feel honest,
        enduring, and at home in their landscape.
